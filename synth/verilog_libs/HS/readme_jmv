============================================================
The fsc0h_d_generic_core_30_lib_src_DFII virtuoso environment 
library was created from the fsc0h_d_generic_core_30.lib.src 
which has the verilog standard cells description.
The Faraday cell symbols were also included.
This library is usefull for mixed-mode simulations.

============================================================
The fsc0h_d_generic_core_30_lib_src_compiled was created with
ncvlog applied to fsc0h_d_generic_core_30.lib.src library.
This library is usefull if standard cells already compiled
are needed for gatelevel digital or mixed-signal simulations.
